# Web Development with Flask Portfolio Overview
Welcome to our team's portfolio. This is a wesbite that allows us to provide links to all of our work, including our first Trivia Game project, the links to which are provided when you selected "Trivia Game" from the menu. On the main menu, you can find links to our project overview and our journals. There is also a Guess the Number, Reaction Time, Rock Paper Scissors, Mad Libs, and Hangman game now. 

## Run Instructions
To run what we have so far, clone this repository and simply run it on your machine. The video we provided outlines the changes and developments we made this week, as well as future goals.

## Latest Changes

### As of Week 10
> In Week 10, the last week of our project, we figured out port forwarding to provide a runtime link of our website and integrated our project into the Night At the Museum collabortaive website. We also made final additions to our project, including finalizing the game images (made by Crystal) and making sure everything in our website worked and looked great. The aracade theme was a bit of a challenge but ended up really pulling our website together. 

### As of Week 9
> This week we have switched responsibilities - so everyone who worked on front-end is working on the back-end and vice versa - and set new goals. On Monday, we made our main page more aesthetically pleasing by adding photos and setting a proper theme. Following the lecture on embedding on Tuesday, we added in all of our portfolio repl.its as embeds into the .html files. This way, when you click on a link, it takes you straight to the running code! However, Repl.It is down right now but our direct links can still be seen. There are two new games added: Rock, Paper Scissors, and Mad Libs. Our About Us page also now includes pictures, included in the for loop, and there is a new page that includes all of our games and also utilizes a for loop in Jinja. Several comments have been made here and there, with more to come. 

### As of Week 8
> This week was student week and we set our goals early on and worked hard to meet them. Ida and Nivu would work on the cosmetics (Jinja & CSS), Dane and Eva would work on incorporating Bootstrap, and Crystal would develop routes and flow and create direct paths from one source to another instead of linkins. We also added an About Us page and spent time formatting our website and working on cosmetics-- adding cards, updating buttons, and changing colors.  

### As of Week 7
> This week we focused more on organizing ourselves on IntelliJ and Github. We reassessed what we were doing and decided that we would attempt to create the majority of our website from scratch as opposed to what we were previously doing, exclusively utilizing what we had been given. We've decided that this will be more effective in aiding our learning experience. At the beginning of the week, we were still using repl.it. With Boostrap and Jinja, we added more pages to our website and created a navigation bar. 

## Map of Provided Code To Meet AP CSP Requirements
| Criteria | Web Portfolio Usage |
| --- | --- |
| Big Idea 1: Creative Computing | Incorporated our own ideas and interests to fufill our visions. |
| Big Idea 2: Data | Defined and established data in our Python files. Rendered the data through the use of HTML (Backend to fontend). |
| Big Idea 3: Algorithms and Programming | Learned HTML and CSS syntax and applied knowledge in building our website. Also defined Python dictionaries for About Us and All Games pages and established Jinja templates for our navigation bar. |
| Big Idea 4: Computer Systems and Network | As of Week 10, both Dane and Eva are able to run their own web serve on their Raspberry Pis. |
| Big Idea 5: Impact of Computing | We learned that a website can be a very beneficial way of displaying information and sharing ideas to group members or individuals. |

## Class Grading Criteria

**Critical Thinking, Program, Design, Logic, Implementation - Portfolio and Project complexities:** 
* Our README.md displays certain features of our project through the week changes, as well as the overview of our code and requirements. It shows how we worked together as a team and worked through the use of logic, design, and code to create our project. Links located at the bottom of this page highlight our design features through our project plan and padlets, as well as our code and algorithms in our journals, and in the AP CSP requirements above.

**Communication and Presentation, Testing:**
* [Raspberry Pi Link](http://99.88.196.26:80) 
* [N@tM Link](http://ntm.nighthawkcoders.cf/) 
* [Github Link](https://github.com/D1935827V/p2triviaweb)

**Collaboration in the development of a solution:** 
* [Peer collaboration document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tYky2fXS1FWZIx98fL1k2qPWL4rRHPx06US9KwHXmNU/edit)

**Creativity and Intangibles:**
* A big highlight of our project was our arcade theme. It fit perfectly with our portfolio for showcasing other projects, which were mostly our Python games.
* Challenges we overcame were integrating our project into the N@tM website, with getting our pictures to load and dealing with code getting deleted, figuring out how to port-foward with at&t and learning the router, and many more throughout the trimester. We all worked great as a team to solve every problem and help each other out, which allowed us to learn **so** much.
