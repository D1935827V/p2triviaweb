# Run Instructions
To run what we have so far, clone this repository and simply run it on your machine. The video we provided outlines the changes and developments we made this week, as well as future goals. 

# Portfolio Overview
Welcome to our team's portfolio. This is a wesbite that allows us to provide links to all of our work, including our first Trivia Game project, the links to which are provided when you selected "Trivia Game" from the menu. On the main menu, you can find links to our project overview and our journals. There is also a Guess the Number game, the links for which are still in progress. 

# Week 8 CHanges
This week, we set our goals early on and worked hard to meet them. Ida and Nivu would work on the cosmetics (Jinja & CSS), Dane and Eva would work on incorporating Bootstrap, and Crystal would develop routes and flow and create direct paths from one source to another instead of linkin. We also added an about me page and apent time formatting our website.

# Week 7 Changes
This week we focused more on organizing ourselves on IntelliJ and Github. We reassessed what we were doing and decided that we would attempt to create the majority of our website from scratch as opposed to what we were previously doing, exclusively utilizing what we had been given. We've decided that this will be more effective in aiding our learning experience. At the beginning of the week, we were still using repl.it. With Boostrap and Jinja, we added more pages to our website and created a navigation bar.
