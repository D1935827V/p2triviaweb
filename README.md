  * created the ending files.
### As of Week 1
* Decided on making a trivia game.
* Came up with Project Plan.
  * Goals for meeting the requirements.
* Began playing with code and trying to create it.
* Made journals.



# Purpose
* To get a basis of coding skills.
* To get to the higher level of ideas for coding/Meet the AP requirements.
* To work and collaborate with a team.
* To meet the next level of teamwork.
* To meet the next level of delivery.
* To establish a digital relationship with our pair/trio, scrum team, and teacher (with Slack, Zoom, and Padlet).
* To establish self-grading.

# How-To
To play the game, choose an option from the menu. You have the option to exit or select easy, medium, or hard mode.

Once you have selected a mode, a question will appear with 3 answer choices. Choose the answer that you think it is!

If you are correct, it will say correct with your score in green. If you are incorrect, it will say incorrect with your score in red.

Finally, when you have answered all of the questions you get a gold animation if you got 100%, a green animation if you got above 70%, and a red animation if got lower than 70%.

# Overview of Code
### Main Menu File
* main.py: Menu for the game.
### Questions Files
* easy.py: The questions and code for the questions on easy mode. Involves keeping the score, randomizing the questions, and displaying correct or incorrect at the end of answering each question. Also has the color.
* medium.py: The questions and code for the questions on medium mode. Involves keeping the score, randomizing the questions, and displaying correct or incorrect at the end of answering each question. Also has the color.
* hard.py: The questions and code for the questions on hard mode. Involves keeping the score, randomizing the questions, and displaying correct or incorrect at the end of answering each question. Also has the color.
### Endings Files
* endings.py: Has our 6 different endings in a 2D Array with thir colors.
* ending_control: Imports all of the ending animations.
* bad_ending.py: Code for the bad ending animation.
* mid_ending.py: Code for the medium ending animation.
* good_ending.py: Code for the good ending animation.

### 21st Century Reqirements
* Critical Thinking, Program, Design, Logic, Implementation - CaTP 1, 2, 3: design, documentation of goals prior to implementation, coding, algorithms, and meeting technical goals. 5pts
** ^Journals, Padlet, Repository**
* Communication and Presentation, Testing - CaTP 4, 5: Evidence showing completeness according to design and goals. Ability of Students to understand work, ability of Students to understand instructions or videos, showing how to run and execute. Code organization, comments, documentation are all part of communication. 5pts
** ^Working together through repository, Zoom, Comments, and READ.md **
* Collaboration, CaTP 6: Collaborative in the development of a solution, acknowledging contribution of others, appropriate behaviors and employing ethics (ie no copying). Performing peer evaluations as requested by Teacher. 5pts
** ^Teamwork and self-grading **
* Creativity and Intangibles: The intangibles are participation, active learning, being proactive, genuine effort, positive attitude, inside-outside-the-box efforts. Creativity is running with an idea, being exited about that idea, and attempting a technical design and solution (note: sometimes it is ok if that idea does not completely work) 5pts
** ^Ideas, playgrounds, implementing new things, repository, and other projects **
